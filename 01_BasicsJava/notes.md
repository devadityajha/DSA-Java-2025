# Notes — Basics

## Operators

- `%` → modulo
- `==` compares values
- `=` is assignment

## If/Else

- Nested ifs make code harder to read → prefer logical operators.

### If/Else- Common mistakes

- Always cover both `if` and `else` (and `else if`) cases.
- Common mistake: forgetting braces `{}` for single-line if statements.
