### Que done attempt yet -- `Brute force`

1. 2 sum
2. 3 sum
3. find the maximum and minimum elment of array
4. Find the first repeating element in an array if not then print -1
5. Find the second element and first in the given array with optimized approach
6. Find the unique no. of array which is not repeated
7. find the sum of all element in array
8. search the given element x in array. If present then return the index else return -1
9. Count the no. of occurences of partclular element x, If not found, return 0 ;
10. Find the index of where x element present;
11. Find the last occurence of an element x in a given array(find last index of x);
12. Count the no. of elements are strictly greater than value x;
13. find the maximum and minimum elment of array

### 6 Sep ArrayAdvance.java- `Optimised approach`

1. Reverse the Array
2. Rotate the array by k element to the right
3. Left Rotate Array`(in noteboook only)`

### 8 sep ArrayAdvance.java `Optimised approach`

3. Given an array and multiple queries (l, r), find the sum of elements between indices l and r (inclusive)- Prefix Sum Pattern.
4. 2 Sum in Sorted Array using 2 pointers

### 11 sept ArrayAdvance.java

`Direct Indexing (Presence Array)`  
5. Check if number is present in array or not

6. Find the element that occurs the most (mode of array).

7. Find all duplicates in the array. `l.c 442`

### 12 Sept

`Direct Indexing (Presence Array)` Approach

8. Find duplicate elements in array-- only one duplicate `l.c 287`

### 14 Sept

9. Contains Duplicate (boolean/hashset)--Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct. `LC 217---only in vs code`
10. Missing Number-- `LC 268--should be done in o(1), but i used o(n) space complexity `
11. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array----`LC 448--only in vs code also not optimized approach`
